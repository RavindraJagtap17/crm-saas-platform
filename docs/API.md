# API Reference

This file tracks only what actually exists in the codebase right now. It will grow as each step
adds real endpoints — see Section 22 of the Final Specification for the complete, final API
surface this is building toward.

Base URL (local): `http://localhost:4000`

## GET /health

Confirms the API process is up. No authentication required.

**Request**

```
GET /health
```

**Response — 200 OK**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime": 12.345,
  "timestamp": "2026-08-25T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Everything else

Any other path currently returns `404`:

```json
{ "error": "Not found: GET /whatever" }
```

This is expected — no other routes are implemented yet (Step 1 is scaffold only).
